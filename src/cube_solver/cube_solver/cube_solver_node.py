"""
cube_solver_node
=================

A ROS2 node that consumes a full Rubik's Cube solution string and streams
individual moves to an ESP32-based hardware controller over a serial link.

Responsibilities:
- Subscribe to a solution topic (std_msgs/String) carrying a space-separated
  sequence of cube moves (e.g., "R U R' U' F2").
- Send each move to the ESP32 on /dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 baud, one per line.
- Wait for a per-move acknowledgment line "DONE" from the ESP32 before sending
  the next move; aborts on timeout or serial errors.
- Publish each move to a telemetry topic for UI/monitoring purposes.

Interfaces:
- Subscribes:  /cube_solution (std_msgs/msg/String)
- Publishes:   /cube_move    (std_msgs/msg/String)
- Serial port: /dev/ttyUSB0, 115200 baud, 1s read timeout; 10s total wait per move

Notes:
- The node logs connection status, incoming solutions, per-move progress,
  acknowledgments, and error conditions.
- If the serial device is unavailable at startup, the node continues to run,
  but attempts to send moves will warning-log and return failure.

    ROS2 node that streams cube moves to an ESP32 with ACK handshaking.

    This node bridges high-level cube solutions to low-level actuator control
    by:
    - Listening for complete solution strings on the ``cube_solution`` topic.
    - Parsing the string into discrete moves.
    - Sending each move to an ESP32 over a serial connection.
    - Waiting for a ``DONE`` acknowledgment per move before proceeding.
    - Publishing each move on the ``cube_move`` topic for dashboards.
